Agile Integration

This project facilitates the synchronization of master patient records across different healthcare providers. It is important to have consistent patient information across these multiple providers so that patients can receive consistent care. For that to occur, their personal and medical information must be shared. Additionally, updates to the patient record must flow across the providers to maintain accuracy and currency.
